            Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear.
        </b></p>
        <p>
            At depth 0, only direct light hits the camera, so we can only see the light directly comes from the light source.<br>
			At depth 1, light that bounces directly off of the objects and hits the camera appears, 
			but the spheres are pitch black. Although we should be able to see the reflected light source, the light is further away from the camera than the spheres and thus the spheres are only black.<br>
			At depth 2, we are able to see more, but the right sphere is mostly black since most rays are refracted and yet to be seen, and the left sphere can be seen to appear glassy: light could be refracted once at this depth and is still inside the glass.<br>
			At depth 3, we start to see refractions. light is able to bounce off of the scene, off of an object, and then finally off of the right sphere to make the right-most sphere appear glassy. But I have to mention that we can notice that the right sphere in the left sphere is still black, which is because the ray depth is not enough.<br>
			At depth 4&5, they are almost the same, we start to see the light spot on the right wall. This focus effect is due to two refractions and two reflections inside the glass. i.e., light → glass refract → glass reflect → glass reflect → glass refract → object → camera. And appears lighter.

			alpha = 0.005, rather dark, with only a little ray to the directly illuminated parts.<br>
			alpha = 0.05, add a lot more brightness to the directly illuminated parts.<br>
			alpha = 0.25, much brighter now! Though some remain metalic, pretty amount of parts have been vivid.
			alpha = 0.5, almost real, very bright and smooth.

            Show two images of scene `CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae` rendered using cosine hemisphere sampling (default) and your importance sampling. The sampling rate should be fixed at 64 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5. Briefly discuss their difference.

		<p>Difference: The hemisphere sampled bunny is much noisier which is largely due to 
			the fact that hemisphere sampling works poorly with the Beckmann function, and is accentuated 
			by the fact that microfacet bsdf's require continuity to appear glossy. In contrast, the right picture,
			with importance sampling, adjusted for microfacet bsdf's, is able to create this vivid 
			effect.
