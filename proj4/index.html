<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p>
<p>simulation using a mass-spring model. At a high-level, the cloth simulator is driven by equations of motion from classical mechanics and a dedicated cloth data structure. We began with building the data structures to represent the cloth as a deformable mesh of point masses connected by springs. Then adding force modeling and other physical constraints combined with numerical integration over time to simulate movement. The motion of each point mass on the grid is governed by the cumulative effect of the spring forces (obeying Hooke's Law) and external forces.
  This project was a great introduction to animation. At the core of everything are real-world physics formulas, but we use a lot of kind of approximation to get vivid effect and results. It is pretty satisfying.</p>
<h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>

<p>In this part I build cloth by pushing all point_masses and spring vector to apply the structual, shear, and bending constraints between point masses.</p>
<p>Because we need to store these point masses in the point_masses vector IN ROW-MAJOR (X-AXIS) ORDER, we need to have a loop for a row first, then have a loop for every row. For mass's position, we need to calculate (width * i / (num_width_points - 1)), (height * j / num_height_points - 1) first.
  Then, remember to judge whether it is vertical or horizontal. For each orientation, set the position as what we are asked to. After pushing back all point_masses, just iterate through pinned to find point_masses with index in pinned, and set their pinned to true.
  finally, follow the rules for each constraint, just go through every point_masses to add spring in vector springs.
</p>

<p>We implemented external forces and spring correction forces in this part</p>
<p>first, calculate external forces by gadd all elements inexternal_accelerations together and multiple by mass. Second, calculate spring correction forces. remember to judge whether enable constraints. use the formula to get results.
  After that, update position for each point_mass. use given formula to change their position, and let their last_position be like point_masses[i].position. remember to not move pinned point_mass.
  finally, update constraint position. For each spring, apply this constraint by correcting the two point masses' positions such that the spring's length is at most 10% greater than its rest_length at the end of any time step. remember there are 3 situations.
  (1)none is pinned. (2)one of them is pinned (3) both are pinned(change nothing in this situation).
</p>

<p>Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. To do so, pause the simulation at the start with P, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing P again. You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by pressing R.
  Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks; how does the cloth behave from start to rest with a very low ks? A high ks?
  What about for density?
  What about for damping?
  For each of the above, observe any noticeable differences in the cloth compared to the default parameters and show us some screenshots of those interesting differences and describe when they occur.</p>

<p>we choose three different ks here. the left one is with ks = 50000; middle one is with ks =500; the right one is with ks = 50.</p>
<p>we can discover that with the decreasing of the ks, the cloth will be more flexible, and have more wrinkles. This is because with smaller ks, spring can be more easily to stretch. With high ks, it can be less felxible and with fewer wrinkles.</p>

<p>left: density = 5; middle: density = 35; right: density = 500</p>
<p>we can realize that with higher density, it will be more heavy for the cloth, so it has bigger pull force between pinned point_mas. Also, higher density makes it have more wrinkles
  Compared with high density, low density will make cloth more flat, and only have small folders.

<p>left: damping = 0.011494%; middle: damping = 0.206897% (close to default value); right: damping = 0.873563</p>
<p>We can discover that with higher damping, it will fall slower when compared with lower damping. And for lower damping such as 0.01, it will swing more time before stop. This is because, with smaller damping, it will lose less energy than before. It will take more time to consume all the energy.
  With very high damping, such as 0.9, we can not clearly see it has accelerated in the process.
</p>
<p>we have compared all these higher and lower value for 3 parameters with default parameters.(the default parameter cloth is plot at the begining of the part 2)</p>

<p>In this part, we implemented collision for sphere and plane. For sphere, use position of origin point and point_mass's position to get the position of tangent point, and judge whether the length is less than radius of the sphere. Then get correction vector: tan_point - pm.last_position. Finally, change the position of point_mass to pm.last_position + (1 - friction) * correct_pos
  For plane, For plane, use point on plane, normal vector of this plane and position of pm to get tangent point. Remember that SURFACE_OFFSET are needed to get tangent point. We should make it a little bit above plan by minus SURFACE_OFFSET. We need to judge whether the collision has happened by check whether last position and position now are on different sides of plane.(use dot between position - point and normal to see if one is negative and one is positive). Then update position like what we do for sphere.
  Finally, update 'simulate'. Just go through collision_objects for every point_mass, and call collide function.

<p>In this part, we implement spatial hashing. First, for hash_position, build w,h and t as what we are asked to, then use floor to find the cloest 3D box. About unique key for hash table, we use 1000*dw + 100* dh + 10*dt.
  This is because dw,dh and dt are small. In this way it will be unique. 
  Second, for build_spatial_map, call hash_position in iterations for point_masses, and judge that whether map has a key equal to this return value of hash_position. If map.find(hash) == map.end(), we should create a new key by applying emplace function, and then push &pm on this map[hash].
  Third, for self_collide, iterate over each map[hash], and see whether there is self-collision by comparing length for every element in map[hash] and pm with 2 * thickness. if < 2*thickness, update the position of pm. Notice that here we need to find average of correction vectors. So we need to do corr_vec /= count, and scale down by simulation_steps after the end of the iterations.

<p><b>1.Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.</b></p>
<p>As is implemented in the quetsion, Our shaders are written in GLSL, a C like language, and have two parts:<br>
  Vertex Shaders(.vert files) apply transforms to vertices, modifying properties like their position and normal vectors.
   All vertex values are calculated by barycentric coordinates across the face of the polygon. <br>
  Fragment Shaders(.frag files) take in calculated geometric attributes of the fragment as computed in the
    vertex shader to compute a final color value.
</p>
<p><b>2.Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.</b></p>
<p>The Blinn-Phong Shading model considers light contributions of three different types: the ambient light, diffuse light, 
  and specular reflections. Ambient light can be thought of as the DC intensity reflecting uniformly off of all objects in
   the scene. Diffuser lighting is the a function of the local surface normal relative to the illumination source. Using 
   Lamberts cosine law, the surface normals that point closer to the light source are those with the highest intensties. 
   Finally, specular reflection relates the illumination source position, the surface normal, and the viewing position to 
   produce a glare characteristic of glossy materials. The images below demonstrate each of these contributions in isolation
    while the final image poses them as a weighted sum. Depending on the weights of each contribution, we can simulate the 
    appearance of different materials.<br>
    I just set Kd = 1, Ks = 0.8, Ka = 0.15, p = 8 and Ia just the vec3(1,1,1) according to the experiment and guess.

<p>mapping results in the visual application of texture to the cloth surface, but doesn’t actually change the geometry. Displacement mapping is an extension of bump mapping that does change the cloth mesh geometry, in addition to surface appearance by altering the vertex positions according to the grooves of the texture.</p><br>

<p>Using a low resolution mesh for the sphere results in a blockier, more polygon-like shape for both shaders. Displacement mapping is largely ineffective as the roughness of the surface is dominated by sharp edges due to the limited resolution. With a higher resolution sphere, there are sufficiently many vertices to be displaced to reflect the texture, as intended.</p>
